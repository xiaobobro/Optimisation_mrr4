The concept of "integrated optics" was inspired by integrated electronics and has developed rapidly since its introduction. Silicon materials have a large refractive index, so a stronger binding force on the light field can effectively improve the integration of photonic devices. At the same time, its preparation has advantages such as mature technology, low cost, good performance, and large optical signal processing capacity. Silicon Photonics research has risen and continued to develop. At present, silicon-based photonic chips have integrated photonic devices with different functions and can realize various functions. The microring resonator is one of the most important optical structures in silicon-based photonics because of its simple structure and easy integration, and is widely used in integrated photonic devices with different functions.
